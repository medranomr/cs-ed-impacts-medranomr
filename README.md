# Impacts on Society

<!Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level. Broadly explain how this document details how you plan to incorporate issues of computing impacts on society in your course/>

AP Computer Science Principles offers a multidisciplinary approach to teaching the underlying principles of computation. The course will introduce students to the creative aspects of programming, abstractions, algorithms, large data sets, the Internet, cybersecurity concerns, and computing impacts. AP Computer Science Principles will give students the opportunity to use technology to address real-world problems and build relevant solutions. Additionally, students will complete lessons on digital citizenship as provided through the school district.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

<!Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs): https://bloomstaxonomy.net />

Students will understand human, cultural, and societal issues related to technology. 

Students will be knowledgeable about legal and ethical behavior related to their use of technology and information.

Students will predict the possible effects of their use and creation of technology.


### Learning Activities and Assessment

<!Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?/>

Students will participate in various online discussions through the canvas platform. Each discussion topic will address different human, cultural, and societal issues related to technology. They will be provided with prompts based on videos or readings assigned throughout each unit. They will also be asked to read and respond to their classmates' contributions. Below are some sample assignments:
    
  - Students will watch the video *AI, Ain't I A Woman?* and respond with their thoughts on AI identifying gender. This will lead into discussion on machine learning and the importance of the data it is based on.

  - Students will read Chapter 5 of *Weapons of Math Destruction* and respond to the following prompt: "This chapter discusses many technologies associated with criminal justice and policing, and issues with these technologies. How do you think these issues should be addressed? What do you think is the best solution?"
 
 - Students will watch the video "Why AI doesn't speak every language" and consider the effect of the data set they choose for their projects and how this impacts society. Students would then be asked to create their data set for some of their own slang, language, or idioms like the researcher in the video did. Then create and run a program that would try to translate something new given their data set.
 
 - Students will watch the video "Why are There So Few Women in Computere Science?" this video answers the question, provides a quick history of computer science from a gender perspective, and provides suggestions on increasing participation in computer science. Students will also be asked to share their thoughts on the video in an online discussion and to read and respond to their classmates' contributions.
 
Students will also participate in group discussions during class to share out their findings and conclusions based on their readings. Each person will complete their choice of readings and take notes. For the discussion, each person in the group will be given two minutes to share their initial thoughts from their chosen readings. After initial thoughts are shared students will discuss the prompts they were given and decide what they want to share out to the class.

Finally, students will participate in a summative discussion. A series of debates on topics discussed throughout the year. Pairs of students will be provided with a prompt, they will gather evidence about the prompt, and decide amongst themselves who will argue in favor of the prompt and who will argue against it. First, students will prepare and recite their initial speeches. They will then have a few days to prepare their rebuttals. They will present their rebuttals and once again have a few days to prepare their closing statements. Finally, they will present their closing statements and answer audience questions.

### Assessment
<!Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above./>

For online discussions, students will be assessed based on their participation and use of evidence to support their arguments.

For group discussions and class presentations, students will be individually assessed using the following rubric:

| Objective  | Met | Not Met |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Notes for Resource #1  |   |   |
| Notes for Resource #2  |   |   |
| 2 Minute Summary  |   |   |
| Group Discussion  |   |   |
| Class Presentation |  |  |

For the summative discussions, students will be assessed by the teacher and their peers using the following rubric:

### Outcomes
<!Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society./>

This plan will facilitate equity and inclusion by providing students with some examples of inequities in computing as well as current steps being taken to address them and provide greater inclusion. Further, students will be asked to consider inequities they may see and how they could be corrected. Finally, students will be asked to consider the impacts and accessibility of their own work.

This plan will help broaden participation in computing by including readings and videos of participation data in computer science. Students will be asked to consider barriers to entry to that world and how they can participate in that world. This in turn will facilate diversity in computing given the demographics of the school.

This plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society by helping students to consider their own roles as creators and the effects of their work on the world around them. To consider how can their work be used with good or malicious intent. To reflect on how they can make their work inclusive and how their work can improve equity.
